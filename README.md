I'd like to acknowledge **Irina Demko** for her insightful work on fan charts, which I encountered during my studies and which served as the inspiration for this project. The fan chart concept is derived from the car accident chart.

üéØ **This analysis utilizes a flight database from an SQL course.** 
Data manipulation and retrieval were performed using PostgreSQL. 
Due to Tableau's incompatibility with .sql files, Excel was employed as an intermediary for data preparation.
Tableau was the primary visualization tool used for this analysis.
